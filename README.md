### ðŸŽ¶ A poorly written blind-test bot powered by https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot
A collaborative blind-test Discord bot.

Everyone gives suggestions to the bot in DM, songs are added in a common pool. Every song is then picked randomly from the pool (the author of the suggestion cannot play).

Everyone types in the chat to play :   
+1 point is awarded to the first player who finds the correct artist   
+1 point is awarded to the first player who finds the correct title   
+3 point is awarded to the first player who types both answers at the same time (assuming no one found neither of them)   

There is a tolerance for typos in the analysis of answers (Levenshtein distance).
